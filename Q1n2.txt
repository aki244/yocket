Ans. 1 There might be a few reasons for this to happen-

i) A user is requesting for the OTP a large number of times.
--> To fix this A person can only request an OTP from his phone number in an incremental time fashion
For example after the 1st OTP request, the second OTP request will be made after 5mins, the next request could be made in 10mins and so on so forth.


ii) A new OTP is requested every time the user visits the website or opens the app.
--> For this we can save the auth token in local storage / cookies, once the user has successfully logged in. As a result, the user will not have to request an OTP the next time he logs in.


iii) There is a possibility of excessive forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts.
--> Here we can track the domain or IP address of the machine/server to prevent brute force attack. We can also detect <script> tags to check for any script injections.


iv) We donâ€™t know when the amount is spent above the limit.
--> In this case we can set a threshold for the balance amount and have a notification or message system send out an alert when the balance reaches or crosses the limit.



Ans. 2 	We can save a list of keywords in the database and then block videos or other related content that contains the term in the title/description/any part of the video. For example, if we enter the keywords 'Spiderman' and 'Spoiler,' any content containing any or both of these terms will be excluded.
